* In developement stage of code
<2021-08-25 Wed>
+ initially named analyze_data.py
+ renamed classify_volume_horizon.py
+ *.dat files are horizon (xyz) from ODT
+ Some .dat files are concatenated version of others w/ units associated
+ Use some horizons to classify voxels and test *bool_test.dat

* Export all_inversion+ horizons that were constrained with well log tops (7 different contacts)
<2021-08-30 Mon>
+ Perform the calculation with updated classify_volume_horizon.py code
** Shell data
+ Takes ~1 min to grid the horizons (down sampled from 10X2 m bin spacing to ~150 m)
  This is requried in order to keep computation time low and high resolution results wrt horizons aren't necessary
+ Takes ~10 min / horizon to do calculation and to store all the data
+ Keep a copy of all orientations in /Above_horizon
+ Keep a copy of distances in /Dist_from_horizon

* Write code for do same thing with Chevron data
<2021-09-02 Thu>
+ Loading previously gridded horzions & not recalculating
+ Assuming that the calculation will take ~8x as long since there are about 8 more data points
+ Renamed /Above_horizon and /Dist_from_horizon to account for which volume they pretain to.
+ Each horizon takes ~ 42 minutes

* Update w/ remapped horizons all_inversion+2.data
<2021-10-08 Fri>
+ Have run shell_classify_volume_horizon.py
+ Running on chevron_classify_volume_horizon.py
  - This takes about 30 mins / horizon
+ Moved previous gridded horizons to gridded_horizons_old

* Classify volume on horizon complete for all_inversion+2.dat\
<2021-10-11 Mon>
+ All old files from all_inversion+ are moved to directories *old here

* Update w/ remapped manual picked horizons /Raw_data/all_?_4*.dat
<2022-02-14 Mon>
+ Keep in mind that analysis is different for east and west of the fault
+ East contains Pico lower through Basement & West contains Mohnian-delmontian through Basement
+ ODT exports of bulk horizon data are now contained in Raw_data
+
