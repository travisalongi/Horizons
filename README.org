* In developement stage of code
+ initially named analyze_data.py
+ renamed classify_volume_horizon.py
+ *.dat files are horizon (xyz) from ODT
+ Some .dat files are concatenated version of others w/ units associated
+ Use some horizons to classify voxels and test *bool_test.dat
<2021-08-30 Mon>
* Export all_inversion+ horizons that were constrained with well log tops (7 different contacts)
+ Perform the calculation with updated classify_volume_horizon.py code
** Shell data
+ Takes ~1 min to grid the horizons (down sampled from 10X2 m bin spacing to ~150 m)
  This is requried in order to keep computation time low and high resolution results wrt horizons aren't necessary
+ Takes ~10 min / horizon to do calculation and to store all the data
+ Keep a copy of all orientations in /Above_horizon
+ Keep a copy of distances in /Dist_from_horizon
